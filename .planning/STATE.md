# Project State

## Project Reference

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-loop gate is non-negotiable: if judge cannot discriminate good from flawed review by >=2.0 points, do not build the loop
- Optimiser must never receive NDA text — enforced at call site in loop.py
- Temperature = 0 on all LLM calls for reproducibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 requires a researcher decision before running: confirm the minimum acceptable score gap threshold (suggested >=2.0 points) and document rationale
